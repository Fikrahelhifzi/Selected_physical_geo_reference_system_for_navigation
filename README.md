The basic of knowledge and understanding of the relation between gravity and the shape of the Earth. Skills of using the global geopotential models as the source of information about gravity field. Changes of gravity in relation with deformation of the Earthâ€™s shape. Also, using matlab, we are trying to understand of celestial, terrestrial and local coordinate systems and dependencies between these frames in aspect static and kinematics cases.
